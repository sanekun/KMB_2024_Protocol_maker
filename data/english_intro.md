Hi there!  
This page introduce `Softwares for Biofoudnry` presented in 2024 KMB.  
**Main software `Protocol Maker` can input research note like format convert to automated protocol(script)**  

- In the left sidebar, click `2. Protocol Maker`, `3. Project Viewer`, `4. Sequence Viewer` is available to the public.

The poster talks about the importance of software required for Biofoundry operation.
- Let's imagine we make 1000 different Plasmids.
> 1. Design and order at least 2,000 primers
> 2. Conduct actual experiments
> 3. Check and decision making PCR or assembly results
> 4. Final sequence confirmation and evaluation

Several different devices are involved and you need to determine whether the previous step was performed well in order to move on to the next step.
**Automation must include not only equipment movement but also data transmission and decision making.**

We divide the steps involved in research into `Project`, `Task`, and `Workflow`.
Developing and connecting software to automate each step, starting with `Protocol Maker`.  

The poster is on display in **P-2** and can also be viewed online through this page.  
If you have any questions regarding this, please leave an email in the form below. Thank you.
